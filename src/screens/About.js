    <DescriptionParagraph>
      I'm currently an incoming junior at
      <span title="UCüÖ±">University of California, Berkeley</span>. I'm working
      on my B.A. in Computer Science with a minor in Music. I enjoy writing
      software, expressing creativity through code, and building things for
      people to use. I care a lot (sometimes excessively) about user experience
      and frontend design. With 4+ years of experience with Node.js, React,
      HTML/CSS/JS, and Python, most of what I build is for the web (though I've
      been delving into

      When I'm not in class or otherwise too busy, you can catch me at
      hackathons, in the practice rooms, or making something in the kitchen.
      Right now, I'm working on Bach's Fugue in C Major as well as perfecting my
      own (quarantine) bread recipe. You might also find me playing

      that's been stuck in my head.
